Project description: Leveringing C++ classes to draw simple shapes using SDL


Your Image:  
  (1) What is it? 
      An abstract and unbiasedly cute beaver

  (2) What part of the image did you NOT draw?
      N/A

The easiest part of this project:
  Choosing the classess
  Writing the classes

Problems that I had in completing this project:
  Setting up SDL, I had forgotten that there was a script in the repo, and was struggling getting the correct dependencies.
  Deciding on what to draw
